            <h1>GENERAL PROCEDURES AT THE HEARING OF A CHARGE OF MISCONDUCT </h1> <br>   
1.	In the interest of transparency, all hearings are open meetings unless the Chairperson of  <br>   
the SDC is persuaded by the circumstances of the case to direct that the hearing be closed to the University <br>   
 community. <br>   

2.	The initiator leads evidence against the accused student and generally conducts the case for the University. <br>   

3.	The SDC allows the student or such person representing the student a reasonable opportunity to present a defence <br>   
 and to answer the charges. <br>   

4.	Both the initiator and the accused student are allowed to adduce all relevant evidence and <br>   
 call witnesses and to examine and cross-examine witnesses, as appropriate. <br>   

5.	The SDC may also ask the witnesses questions for clarity. <br>   
6.	The SDC may further, of its own accord, call for evidence that it may deem relevant <br>   
 to determine the issue(s) before it. <br>   

7.	The hearing of the SDC is conducted in an informal manner, according to the principles of natural justice  <br>   
and with due regard for the rights of the accused student.  No accused student will be prejudiced by reason of <br>   
 a failure to comply with the rules of procedure or rules of evidence as applied in the ordinary courts. <br>   

8.	If the student is a minor, no disciplinary action(s) will be taken against that student before his/her parent <br>   
 or guardian has also been informed in writing of his/her alleged misconduct <br>   
and has been given a proper opportunity to make a written statement and, if he/she so <br>   
 wishes, to appear before the SDC in person. <br>
