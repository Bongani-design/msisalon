            <h1>PROCEDURE IN THE CASE OF A COMPLAINT OF MISCONDUCT </h1>
            

1.	NOTIFICATION OF MISCONDUCT<br><br>

A student will not be formally charged with misconduct until a written <br>
and signed statement containing an accusation, complaint or allegation made <br>
against the student has been submitted to the Registrar or a person authorised by<br>
 him/her to receive such complaint, provided that nothing contained herein will <br>
 prpromotion the Registrar from laying a complaint of misconduct against a student.<br>

2.	PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION<br><br>

2.1     The Registrar appoints one or more persons to conduct a preliminary investigation <br>
into an accusation, complaint or allegation brought to his/her attention. The Registrar may, <br>
at his/her discretion, conduct the investigation him/herself.<br>

2.2     Such person(s) so appointed submits a written report and/or charge sheet to the
Registrar.<br>

2.3     The person(s) appointed to conduct the preliminary investigation may consult with or<br>
 obtain information from any person, including the student against whom the accusation, complaint <br>
 or allegation has been made.<br>

3.	REFERRAL TO THE STUDENT DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE (SDC)<br><br>

3.1     If the Registrar is of the opinion that there is a prima <br>
facie case and that there are reasonable grounds for a charge of<br> 
misconduct and that the misconduct is of a<br>
serious nature, he/she drafts a written charge or has<br> 
such charge drawn up to be heard by the SDC.<br>

3.2     If the Registrar is of the opinion that <br>
an alleged misconduct of a student constitutes a minor <br>
contravention of the Code, the Registrar may exercise his/her <br>
discretion to decide what further steps should be taken in <br>
response to the alleged misconduct.<br>

4.	NOTICE TO THE ACCUSED STUDENT<br>

4.1     When proceedings against a student are instituted in terms of paragraph 3 above<br>
, the Registrar will give the student concerned not less than fourteen calendar days’ notice<br>
 in writing of the date, time and place of the hearing by the SDC.<br>

4.2	The Notice under this rule will inform the student:<br>

4.2.1    that proceedings under the Students’ Disciplinary Code are to be instituted against him/her <br>
and that a copy of the Code is available for inspection in the Office of the Registrar or on the University<br>
 student website,<br>

4.2.2    of the Rule that the student is alleged to have breached and/or the act(s) of misconduct that the student<br>
 is alleged to have committed. The Notice must set out the charge with sufficient particularity to enable the student<br>
  to prepare for his/her defence,<br>

4.2.3    of his/her right to answer the charge in writing at least four calendar days before the hearing,<br>

4.2.4    of his/her right to attend the hearing to present his/her case, or to be represented at the hearing<br>
 by another student, member of the Student Representative Council or an employee of the University, and<br>

4.2.5    of his/her right if he/she is a minor to be assisted by his/her parent or guardian or,
<br> at the discretion of the SDC, to be assisted by any other person appointed by such parent 
<br>or guardian, provided that nothing contained in this Rule renders the conduct of the SDC void
<br> if the student is not so assisted on the date set for the hearing.<br>

5.	SERVICE OF NOTICE<br><br>

5.1     Service of any written notice and the furnishing of<br>
 particulars in terms of this Code will be by prepaid, registered post<br>
  to the residential address provided either on the most recent application <br>
  form completed by the student for the purpose of registration or on any later <br>
  written notice submitted by the student to the University of a change of address.<br>

5.2     In the case of such service the student will be deemed to have received the Notice <br>
and particulars within five calendar days of the date of posting thereof.<br>

6.	SUSPENSION<br><br>

6.1     No student will be suspended from the University before a hearing is held. However, <br>
the Registrar may use an abridged service of Notice to convene an emergency SDC that will determine<br>
 the need for a temporary suspension which will serve to prohibit such student from:<br>

6.1.1	entering onto the premises of the University, or any part thereof, and/or<br>
6.1.2	using an opportunity resulting from his/her enrolment as a student.<br>

6.2     A temporary suspension in terms of paragraph 6.1 remains in force for the period not exceeding <br>
thirty calendar days or until the disciplinary proceedings in terms of this Code have been completed,<br>
 whichever instance may first occur.<br>

6.3     The suspended student may make written representations to the Principal and Vice Chancellor<br>
 within five calendar days of receipt of written notice of his/her suspension, advancing reasons why<br>
  he/she should not be suspended.<br>

6.3.1   The Principal and Vice Chancellor may at his/her discretion revoke a suspension at any time,<br>
 provided that, notwithstanding such revocation, further steps may be taken to proceed with the disciplinary <br>
 hearing on the charge of misconduct against the student.<br>

6.3.2    The Principal and Vice Chancellor may, at his/her discretion, also confirm the suspension.<br>
