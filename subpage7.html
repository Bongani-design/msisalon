                    <h1> SANCTIONS</h1>
                    
                    1.	When considering an appropriate sanction, the SDC takes account of all mitigating and aggravating<br>
                     factors presented during the hearing.   Further, when considering the appropriateness of the disciplinary <br>
                     measures to be imposed, the SDC ensures that such disciplinary measures are, as far as possible, appropriate <br>
                     to and commensurate with the nature and gravity of the misconduct of which the student has been found guilty. <br>
                      And still further, it is noted that the SDC is also bound by the rules of administrative law and natural justice<br>
                       and the principles of precedent.<br><br>
                    
                    2.       After finding a student guilty of misconduct, the SDC may impose one or more of the following sanctions:<br><br>

                    or further period subject to any condition(s) which the SDC deems reasonable;<br>
                    
                    2.9     denial of the opportunity to register or enrol again as a student at the University for a specified period;<br>
                    
                    2.10   any other appropriate sanction(s) which the SDC deems suitable in the particular circumstances;<br><br>
                    
                    3.	A student who is temporarily or permanently deprived in terms of this Code of the opportunity which he/she<br>
                     has as a student or is temporarily or permanently denied admission to the University, forfeits any claim for<br>
                      repayment, reduction or remission of moneys paid or payable to the University.<br>
